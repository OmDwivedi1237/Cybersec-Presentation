# Lets begin!
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network that allows you to connect to a network without the need to go through a physical connection. So like lets say you work for a company that has a network that you want to use for your work, but you don't want to go there to access all the network devices, well VPNs let you do that!

## Why are these not the best for privacy?
Well for one with a VPN your privacy can be easily broken, and the other is that most of the time the VPN provider has a lot of information about you, and that is not good for your privacy.

## Okay how tf do you break that privacy from a VPN?
There are some ways

## Whats Tor?
Well for one, lets set aside the missconceptions of Tor, no it isn't made for the dark web (Criminals are smart for using though), no its not illegal to use, okay now lets compare VPNs to the Tor onion service, Tor uses something called circuits, basicly like a bunch of servers that make the requests for you, well that sounds like a VPN right? Well not exactly Tor's security is on another level compared to regular VPNs, point is that Tor's security is much better than regular VPNs, and that is why Tor is the best for privacy. If you wanna research into the Tor onion service, you can find it [here](https://torproject.org/)


## Examples of how VPN providers infringe privacy
Lets say the government suspects you for a crime, but you use a VPN, the VPN provider is required by law to provide you with information about you, and that information is used to identify you. Which is called a subpoena. And you might say, "what if I haven't committed any crimes lol", well the government use that as an excuse to get massive amounts of data on users.
