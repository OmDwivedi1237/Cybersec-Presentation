<p>Today we will go over 2 topic we want ya'll to know about:
- why linux gud
- why VPNs aren't all that are advertised as</p>
<hr>
<h2>Lets start with linux!</h2>
<p>Linux® is a free and open source unix-like kernel, which is the like the root of every operating system. Linux® was created a free and open source re-implementation of the Minix kernel, Minix was a closed source UNIX® operating system. In combination with a user space like GNU or Busybox, Linux® is a complete operating system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remember that linux is unix-like not a uppercase unix system, uppercase unix systems are officially licensed by UNIX®.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Now before you go on talking about how its just Om and Yavor blaberring on about linux just hear me out ;)</h2>
<h2>Why Linux is <strong>actually</strong> better</h2>
<p>Well for one linux® is free and open source, others like windows and mac are closed source, and totally not free software.</p>
<p>The other thing is that it's way faster. Lets think of this logicaly, an OS uses system resources to run. A OS like MS Windows uses so many resources to run that it makes the system slower. This also goes for Mac. Linux on the other hand uses less resources to run itself making it faster.</p>
<p>Linux can virtually run on anything, It can on the potatoest of potato systems. Linux runs in all the servers of the websites, social media, you car, your nearest food online ordering system.</p>
<p>If you main tension is over "will my software work on linux?" trust me it probably will. Most games that you might play from Steam will run on linux since Valve® was super nice enough to make a compatibility layer to run our steam games on Linux.</p>
<h2>Okay now that we have talked about linux</h2>
<h3>VPN time!</h3>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Next lets go over VPNs!</h2>
<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a network that allows you to connect to a network without the need to go through a physical connection. So like lets say you work for a company that has a network that you want to use for your work, but you don't want to go there to access all the network devices, well VPNs let you do that!</p>
<h2>Why are these not the best for privacy?</h2>
<p>Well for one with a VPN your privacy can be easily broken, encrypted or not you can be very easily geolocated and fingerprinted and the other is that most of the time the VPN provider keeps a lot of information about you, like every page you visit, and obviously that is not good for your privacy.</p>
<h2>Okay so what do I use then?</h2>
<p>Well for one you can use Tor! Or i2p though I'm not going to talk about that today.</p>
<h2>Whats Tor?</h2>
<p>Well for one, lets set aside the misconceptions of Tor, no it isn't made for the dark web (Criminals are smart for using though), no its not illegal to use, okay now lets compare VPNs to the Tor onion service, Tor uses something called circuits, basicly like a bunch of servers that make the requests for you, well that sounds like a VPN right? Well not exactly Tor's security is on another level compared to regular VPNs, point is that Tor's security is much better than regular VPNs, and that is why Tor is the best for privacy. If you wanna research into the Tor onion service, you can find it <a href="https://torproject.org/">here</a></p>
<h2>Examples of how VPN providers infringe privacy</h2>
<p>Lets say the government suspects you for a crime, but you use a VPN, the VPN provider is required by law to provide you with information about you, and that information is used to identify you. Which is called a subpoena. And you might say, "what if I haven't committed any crimes lol", well the government use that as an excuse to get massive amounts of data on users. Anyways point is the fact that they have the info to give is bad.</p>
